* When user accesses the website, they land on the main page where they can click on Get Started to add, read, and delete notes.
* Clicking on the nav bar at any time sends users back to the main page.
* Once users enter the notes page, notes are displayed as a list on the left and they can click on one to read its contest on the right side of the page.
* If users click on New Note, they will be able to enter a title and content for the note. Once all the information is in, users can save the note for later access.
